## Data
The chosen dataset is languages.tsv, this set has 2 columns: language and speakers

### Background
This chart shows the amount of people speaking certain languages. Languages are mapped on x and the amount is mapped on y.
The chart is based on an example from Mike Bardock (link in licensing) and is in most ways unchanged.
The things that changed are mainly spacing and naming.

I did add some extra stuff in css to make the chart readable (see the rotated names on x axis)

### Comments
The code has been commented to show my knowledge of it. (css & js)

### Features
d3-dsv - parse tab-separated values
d3-format - number formatting
d3-scale - position encodings
d3-array - data processing
d3-axis - axes
